# Python Snake Algorithm Simulation
This project was created to demonstrate how simple games like the Snake game can be recreated using modular functions, imported libraries, and program logic handling. I designed dynamic fruit generation with randomized visuals to enhance engagement using the turtle and random Python libraries. I also refactored game loop handling for continuous movement, responsive keyboard controls, and collision detection. I modularized and organized functions for movement, scoring, and termination to improve program maintainability.
